# HTML

### CH.3 LISTS
**oredered lists**
The ordered list is created with the `<ol>` element.
Each item in the list is placed between an opening `<li>` tag and a closing `</li>` tag.

**unordered lists**
The unordered list is created with the `<ul>` element. same thing as the orederd lists we put each item in `<li>` opening and closing tag.

**definition lists**
The definition list is created with the `<dl>` element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.

- `<dt>`: This is used to contain the term being defined.
- `<dd>`: This is used to contain the definition.

**nested lists**
You can put a second list inside an `<li>` element to create a sublist or nested list.


### CH.13 BOXES
**Box Dimensions**
To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.
- _width_: The value can either be given in pixels or using one of the following values:
1. thin
2. medium
3. thick
You can control the individual size of border's sides.

**Limiting Width**
- min-width: specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow.
- max-width: indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.

**Limiting Height**
- min-height.
- max-height.

**overflowing content**
The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content
contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have
one of two values:
- hidden: This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.
- scroll: This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.

**Border, Margin & Padding**
Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:
1. _Border_: Every box has a border. The border separates the edge of one box from another.
2. _Margin_: You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
3. _Padding_: Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.
**The padding and margin properties are very helpful in adding space between various items on the page.**

**border style**
This property can take the following values:
- solid.
- dotted.
- dashed.
- double. 
- groove appears to be carved into the page.
- ridge appears to stick out from the page.
- inset appears embedded into the page.
- outset looks like it is coming out of the screen.
- hidden / none no border is shown.
You can individually change the styles of different border's sides.

**centering content**
you can set the left-margin and right-margin to auto.

**border image**
applies an image to the border of any box. It takes a background image and slices it into nine pieces.

**box shadow**
The box-shadow property allows you to add a drop shadow around a box.


### CH.4 DECISIONS & LOOPS
**switch statements**
A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

**_type coercion:_** that JavaScript can convert data types behind the scenes to complete an operation.
**_weak typing:_** JavaScript is said to use weak typing because the data type for a value can change.

**TRUTHY & FALSY VALUES**
Due to type coercion, every value in JavaScript can be treated as if it were true or false.
- _falsy values_:
VALUE                  | DESCRIPTION
-----------------------|-------------------------------
var highScore = false; | The traditional Boolean false
var highScore = O;     | The number zero
var highScore=10/'score';| Empty value
var highScore;         | A variable with no value assigned to it

- _truthy values_:

VALUE                   | DESCRIPTION
------------------------|------------------
var hi ghScore = true ; | The traditional Boolean true
var highScore = l;      | Numbers other than zero
var highScore ='carrot';| Strings with content
var highScore = 10/5;   | Number calculations
var highScore = 'true'; | true written as a string
var hi ghScore = ' O' ; | Zero written as a string
var highScore = 'false';| false written as a string

**SHORT CIRCUIT VALUES**
Logical operators are processed left to right. They short-circuit (stop) as soon as they have a result - but they return the value that stopped the processing (not necessarily true or false).

**loops**
loops check a condition. if it returns, a code block will run. then the condition will be checked again and it still returns true, the code block will run again. it repeats until the coondition returns false. there are three common types of loops:
- for.
- while.
- do while.

**_For loops_**
a for loop uses a counter as a condition. this instucts the code to run a specified niumber of times. here you can see the condition is made up of three statements:
- initialization.
- condition.
- update.

**_While loops_**
This loop will continue to run for as long as the condition in the parentheses is true. That condition is a counter indicatingthat, as long as the variable i remains less than 10, the statements in the subsequent code block should run.
