# HTML
## introduction
**How Websites Are Created ?**
All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.


## CH. 1 structure
**HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages**
Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag.
Tags act like containers. 

**Attributes Tell Us More About Elements**
Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. 
  

## Ch. 8 extra markup
**Grouping Text & Elements In a Block**
The `<div>` element allows you to group a set of elements together
in one block-level box.

**Grouping Text & Elements Inline**
The `<span>` element acts like an inline equivalent of the `<div>`
element. It is used to either:

**IFrames**
An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page. attributes that you will use it: `src` `height` `width`

**Information About Your Pages**
The `<meta>` element lives inside the `<head>` element and contains information about that web page. 
values for this attribute are:
- description
- keywords
- robots
- author
- pragma
- expires


## CH. 17 HTML5 layout
**Asides**
The `<aside>` element has two purposes:
- When it's inside an `<article>` element, it should contain information that is related to the article.
- When it's  outside an `<article>` element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page.

**Figures**
It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images).The `<figure>` element should also contain a `<figcaption>` element which provides a text decription for the content of the `<figure>` element.

**Sectioning Elements**
Where there is no suitable element to group a set of elements, the `<div>` element will still be used.


## CH. 18 process & design
**Site Maps**
create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site.  you can use a technique called _card sorting_.

**WireFrames**
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. 

**Getting your message across using design**
- content.
- Prioritizing.
- organizing.
- visual hierarchy:
   - size.
   - color. 
   - style
- grouping & similarity:
   - proximity.
   - closure.
   - Continuance.
   - White Space.
   - color.
   - borders.
   - Consistency.
   - headings.

# The ABC of programming 

## 1/a what is a script and how do i create one?
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

**WRITING A SCRIPT**
Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.
1. _DEFINE THE GOAL_.
2. _DESIGN THE SCRIPT_.
3. _CODE EACH STEP_.

## 2/b how do computers fit in with the world around them?
COMPUTERS CREATE MODELS OF THE WORLD USING DATA.

**OBJECTS & PROPERTIES**
_OBJECTS (THINGS)_
In computer programming, each physical thing in the world can be represented as an object.
Each object can have its own:
• Properties
• Events
• Methods
Together they create a working model of that object.

_PROPERTIES (CHARACTERISTICS)_
Each property has a name and a value, and each of these name/value pairs tells you something about each individual instance of the object.

_EVENTS_
WHAT IS AN EVENT?
An event is the computer's way of sticking up its hand to say, "Hey, this just happened!"

_METHODS_
WHAT IS A METHOD?
Methods represent things people need to do with objects. They can
retrieve or update the values of an object's properties.

_PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER_
Events can trigger methods, and methods can retrieve or update an object's properties.


## 1/c how do i write a script for a web page?

HOW HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER?
Web developers usually talk about three languages that are used to create web pages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- CONTENT LAYER (. html files)
- PRESENTATION LAYER (.css files)
- BEHAVIOR LAYER (.js files)
