### CH.16 Images
**Background Images**
The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element using "background-image".

**Repeating Images**
The background-repeat property can have four values:
1. repeat.
  - repeat-x.
  - repeat-y.
2. no-repeat.
3. fixed.
4. scroll.

**Background Position**
When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-position property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed.

**shorthand**
The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the
other background properties you have just seen, and also the
background-color property.


### CH.19 Practical Information
**Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**
SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject.
The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can improve your website's visibility on search engines.

**On-Page SEO**
In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords
(the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order to improve its findability.
1. Page Title.
2. URL / Web Address.
3. Headings.
4. Text.
5. Link Text.
6. Image Alt Text.
7. Page Descriptions.

**Analytics: Learning about your Visitors**
As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing
how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are
leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by Google called Google Analytics.

 1. **How Many People Are Coming to Your Site?**
The overview page gives you a snapshot of the key information you are
likely to want to know. In particular, it tells you how many people are
coming to your site.
 2. **What Are Your Visitors Looking At?**
The content link on the left-hand side allows you to learn more about what the visitors are looking at when they come to your site.
 3. **Where Are Your Visitors Coming From?**
 The traffic sources link on the left hand side allows you to learn where your visitors are coming from.

**Domain Names & Hosting**
In order to put your site on the web you will need a domain name and web hosting.

**FTP & Third Party Tools**
To transfer your code and images from your computer to your hosting company, you use something known as File Transfer Protocol.

### CH.9 Flash, Video & Audio
**How Flash Works**
Since the late 1990s, Flash has been a very popular tool for creating animations, and later for playing audio and video in websites.
If you want to create your own Flash movie, you need to purchase the Flash authoring environment from Adobe.

**Use of Flash**
Since 2005, a number of factors have meant that fewer websites are written in Flash or even use elements of Flash in their pages.
